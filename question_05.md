Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to another function and are executed at a later time or when a certain event occurs. They are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as making API requests or reading files, where the result is not immediately available.

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, is a situation that arises when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations nested inside one another using callbacks. It occurs when callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations sequentially, resulting in deeply nested and indented code that becomes hard to read, understand, and maintain.

Here's an example of callback hell:

```
asyncOperation1(function (error, result1) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    asyncOperation2(function (error, result2) {
      if (error) {
        console.log(error);
      } else {
        asyncOperation3(function (error, result3) {
          if (error) {
            console.log(error);
          } else {
            // ...more nested operations
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
```

As you can see, as more asynchronous operations are added, the code becomes deeply nested and harder to follow. It makes it challenging to handle errors, maintain code readability, and can introduce bugs due to the complexity.

To mitigate callback hell and improve code readability, Promise and async/await were introduced as alternatives. They provide more structured and sequential ways to handle asynchronous code and avoid excessive nesting. Promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together, while async/await provides a more synchronous-like syntax for handling asynchronous code.
